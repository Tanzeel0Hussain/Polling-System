# Polling System

## Requirements

### 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
This application is written in Java, so you will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK). The JDK is essential for compiling and running Java programs.

You can download the JDK from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
To run this code, you can use any Java IDE, such as:

- Eclipse
- IntelliJ IDEA
- NetBeans

These IDEs allow you to easily compile and run the code.

## Steps to Run the Code

### Step 1: Install JDK and IDE
Ensure that you have JDK 8 or later installed and set up on your system. Download and install an IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.

### Step 2: Open Your Preferred IDE
Launch your IDE and create a new Java project.

### Step 3: Copy the Provided Code
Copy and paste the provided Java files into your project. Ensure the class names match the file names, such as:
- `PollingSystem.java`
- `WelcomeFrame.java`

### Step 4: Configure the Package
Make sure all classes are in the same package, for example, `myproject`. If you donâ€™t want to use a package, remove the `package myproject;` line from each file.

### Step 5: Run the Main File
Execute `PollingSystem.java`, as it contains the `public static void main(String[] args)` method, which serves as the application's entry point.

## Which File to Run
Run `PollingSystem.java` to start the application. When executed, it opens the `WelcomeFrame` window, providing options for:
- **Admin Login**
- **User Registration**
- **User Login**

## Software Requirements

### 1. Operating System
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux (any OS that supports Java)

### 2. Java Version
Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed.

### 3. IDE
Any Java IDE like:
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse
- NetBeans

## Application Functionality

### 1. Welcome Screen
The application starts with a welcome screen where users can:
- **Log in as an Admin**
- **Register as a New User**
- **Log in as an Existing User**

### 2. Admin Login
Admins can log in using the default credentials:
- **Email:** `admin@gmail.com`
- **Password:** `admin`

Once logged in, the admin can view the voting results.

### 3. User Registration
New users can register by providing a username and password.

### 4. User Login
Registered users can log in and cast their votes.

### 5. Voting
Users can vote for one of the three candidates:
- **Tanzeel Hussain**
- **Muhammad Sohail**
- **Muhammad Ali**

### 6. View Results
Admins can view the voting results, which display the number of votes each candidate has received.

## Dependencies
This application uses **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). Since Swing is part of the standard Java library, no additional dependencies are required.

## Expected Output
When the application is run, a GUI window opens, allowing users to interact with the polling system. Admins can view the voting results in real-time.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to successfully run the Java polling system. Let me know if you need further assistance!
